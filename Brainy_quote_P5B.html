        <blockquote cite="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/stephen_hawking_627123?src=t_motivational">
            <q>Look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see, 
                and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious.</q>

        <blockquote cite="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/dan_millman_173282?src=t_motivational">
            <q>I learned that we can do anything, but we can't do everything... at least not at the same time. 
                So think of your priorities not in terms of what activities you do, but when you do them. 
                Timing is everything.</q>
